**XMediusSENDSECURE (SendSecure)** is a collaborative file exchange platform that is both highly secure and simple to use.
It is expressly designed to allow for the secured exchange of sensitive documents via virtual SafeBoxes.

SendSecure comes with a **Web API**, which is **RESTful**, uses **HTTPs** and returns **JSON**.

Specific libraries have been published for various languages:
[C#](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-csharp),
**Java**,
[JavaScript](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-js),
[PHP](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-php),
[Python](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-python)
and
[Ruby](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-ruby).

## Authentication (Retrieving API Token)

Authentication is done using an API Token, which must be first obtained based on SendSecure enterprise account and user credentials.
Here is the minimum code to get such a user-based API Token.

```java
import com.xmedius.sendsecure.Client;
import com.xmedius.sendsecure.exception.SendSecureException;

import java.io.IOException;

public class Example {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
              try {
                     String userToken = Client.getUserToken("deathstar", "darthvader", "d@Rk$1De", null, null);
                     System.out.println(userToken);
              } catch (IOException | SendSecureException e) {
                     throw e;
              }
       }
}
```

## SafeBox Creation

Here is the minimum required code to create a SafeBox â€“ with 1 recipient, a subject, a message and 1 attachment.
This example uses the enterprise account's *default* security profile (which requires to be set in the account).

### With SafeBox Helper Class

```java
import com.xmedius.sendsecure.*;
import com.xmedius.sendsecure.helper.*;

import java.io.File;

public class Example {
       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
              try {
                     String userEmail = "darthvader@empire.com";
                     String token = "USER|1d495165-4953-4457-8b5b-4fcf801e621a";
                     String enterpriseAccount = "deathstar";
                     String endpoint = "https://portal.xmedius.com";

                     Safebox safebox = new Safebox(userEmail);
                     safebox.setSubject("Family matters");
                     safebox.setMessage("Son, you will find attached the evidence.");

                     Recipient recipient = new Recipient("lukeskywalker@rebels.com");
                     safebox.getRecipients().add(recipient);

                     Attachment attachment = new Attachment(new File("Birth_Certificate.pdf"), "application/pdf");
                     safebox.getAttachments().add(attachment);

                     Client client = new Client(token, enterpriseAccount, endpoint);
                     SafeboxResponse response = client.submitSafebox(safebox);
              } catch (Exception e) {
                     e.printStackTrace();
              }
       }
}
```
